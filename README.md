# scripts

Collection of basic scripts and exploits that were useful and might come handy in the future.

Some exploits are modified as they did not work out of the box.
There may be antivirus flags which are raised as some of the scripts contain active payloads.
Treat them as false positive's as no script contains malware. 

NOTE: Use Unix/Linux/OSX based system for modifying and deploying as some functions 
use the bash shell commands and may not work without them.
